# STM32-Nucleo144-Embedded-C-Labs
Embedded C and GPIO experiments on STM32 Nucleo-144 using Arduino IDE and STM32CubeIDE

This repository contains hands-on Embedded C and GPIO experiments performed on the STM32 Nucleo-144 F767ZI development board.

The experiments were implemented using both Arduino IDE (STM32Duino) and STM32CubeIDE to understand different embedded development workflows.
